"""A missing prerequisite must say how to install it.

The scripts in tools/ discover their toolchain by searching PATH and known
install locations. That search returns nothing when a tool is absent, and an
empty search result is easy to mishandle: the run either continues and fails
somewhere confusing, or reports success having done nothing.

So two things are asserted here, for every shipped script:

1. discovery never silently continues -- a missing prerequisite must throw;
2. the error tells the user what to run.

The second one is the subtle half. "python not found" is technically correct
and practically useless: the reader still has to know which package, and on a
machine they may not. `tools/test.ps1` gets this right -- it says the host
compiler is needed rather than the ARM cross compiler, explains why, and gives
the exact winget command. That is the standard every other message should meet.
